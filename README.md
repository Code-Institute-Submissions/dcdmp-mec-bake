# Online Baking - Recipe Database

URL - https://dcdmp-mec-bake.herokuapp.com/

This is an online recipe database for all things baked. Giving users the options of creating and manipulate recipes, and browsing for inspiration. Hopefully this can be a growing source of information and a good tool for a user who want's expand their knowledge and keep track of what they've done earlier. The more it's being used, the better it will be for everyone!

I've made this project as my data centric development milestone project, for the Code Institute fullstack web developer program. 
Using knowledge from earlier parts of the cours, and combining it with Python3 and Jinja to show that I've understood and can set up a NoSQL database and connect it to a web application.

The project is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/matsceder/dcdmp-mec-bake) and deployed with [Heroku](https://dcdmp-mec-bake.herokuapp.com/)

## UX
### Design, Mockups and Responsiveness
![Display of responsive design on different devices](documentation/dcdmp-responsive.png)

The design of this project is meant to be simple, with a palate of colors inspired by the cookbooks in the kitchen when I was a kid. It should be easy for anyone to find what they're looking for and navigate easily throughout the page. It's been made with responsive and defensive design in mind, built with mobile first approach. A mockup was made using Figma, where colors and fonts were selected from start, so it would be easier to avoid deviations from the intentions. From there it got even simpler as the page came alive and I wanted do keep down the amount of different colors even more. Frameworks, icons and other sources, is found further down in the document.

- [Desktop](https://www.figma.com/file/iHfhgwJzJyhBJNbnp3ZE7Q/dcdmp-mec-online-baking?node-id=2%3A3)

### User Stories

The purpose of this is for it to be a simple and accessible database for users no matter what their level of skill might be. Examles of probable users.

- As a user with a limited experience from baking, I want to look for inspiration and be able to browse through recipes and sorting out those that are too hard. 
- Aa a slightly more advanced user, I want to perfect that super delicious recipe. Seeing the recipe as a living thing, where small tweaks can be made and easily updated and documented. Getting closer to perfection, step by step.
- A more experienced user who keeps the old family recipes in the memory. That user might be tired of having to write it down every time someone asks for that delicious pie recipe. So now they add the recipe one time, and then they just share the link with friends and family who ask. And with the added benefit that it wont be forgotten.

## Features
This is hopefuly just the beginning of this. I'm hoping this will expand over time, the goal is to maintain and improve the existing features, but also adding new features to make it more usefull and optimized.
### Existing features

- Responsive design - Mobile first application
- Materializecss - Front-end Framework
- Heroku - App deployment
- Git - Version control
- Github - Remote repository
- MongoDB - NoSQL Database
    - Create, Read, Update and Delete recipes

### Planned features and improvements
- User accounts
- Admin controll of removing data
- Commenting sections
- Rating system
- Personal comments and notes to recipes
- Storing multiple modified versions of recipes
- Descriptions of different techniques
- Video showing different techniques or steps in the proces
- Printable PDF-versions of recipes
- Links to related items or products
    - Affiliate links
- Improved functionallity and more efficient code

## Deployment
#### This page is deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Following steps describes the process of deployment.
1. Create a repository, either localy or as in my case, on GitHub.
2. Create a simple app in python using Flask and have it return "Hello World!".
3. Log on to Heroku and create a new app.
4. Connect and log in to Heroku through your terminal. 
5. Set up a requirements.txt-file and also create a Procfile.
6. Follow the steps provided by Heroku inside your app-project in the browser. Initiate a new repo, make an initial commit and push it to Heroku.
7. Set your dyno from the dashboard by typing in $ Heroku ps:scale web=1.
8. On Heroku web page, go to settings and set up your environment variables under "config vars". Add IP and PORT values and save it.
9. Click on "Open App", and it shoudl pop out a new tab in your browser displaying the deployed app.

## Testing
Keeping the app simple by using frameworks and not adding unnecessarily complicated functionality to the back-end part of the project, I don't see the use for automated or unittest testing. All the functionallity has been manually tested in 3 stages to ensure the project will not break when used by end user.

### First Part - Manual testing using Chrome Dev tools

- Responsiveness
    - Working through templates one by one. Using Dev tools, testing the view for different devices, to make sure it doesn't break and keeps content presented nicely.
- CSS Selectors
    - Using Materializecss' front-end framework for functionality benefits came with the downside of having to override or disable a lot of included CSS. So for testing I made sure that everything looks nice upon user interaction.
- Navigation
    - Testing navigation for different devices making sure you're never depending on the browsers back/forward-buttons.
- Database filtration
    - Trying out database filtration in the browser. Testing all combinations of options for type and difficulty.
### Second Part - Standardizing code.
- HTML and CSS
    - Formatted with WebFormatter and validated using W3C Markup Validation Service.
- Python3 - Styled after PEP 8 guide lines

### Third Part - Routes and CRUD
- Making sure that all routes work by thorough testing of CRUD-operations and the connection to MongoDB.
    - Create - Creating new recipes, leaving empty fields and trying to insert different types of values to se how it reacts.
    - Read - Browsing through the recipe database and sorting by type and difficulty. Also using databases for fixed set of options to choose from in recipe creator. For difficulty, type and measurements.
    - Update - Being able to read and modify existing values in the database through the update function attached to each recipe.
    - Delete - Deleting recipes permanently removes data as intended.
